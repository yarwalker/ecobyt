  - when any other plugin used `wp_update_post` function,
  - when user updated product via Quick Edit,
  - could be more possible conditions.

= 1.6.2 - 25/09/2014 =
* Feature Upgraded - Orders - Orders Numbers - Additional custom date prefix added. Suggested by Sergio.
  Value is passed directly to PHP `date` function, so most of PHP date formats can be used.
  Visit PHP `date` <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php">function page</a> for more information on valid date formats.
